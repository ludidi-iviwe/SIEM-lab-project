## 📌 Overview
This project showcases my **hands-on experience in building a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab** using virtualization technologies.  
Through this lab, I simulated real-world cyber attacks and monitored them using a SIEM dashboard, which helped me understand **how security teams detect and respond to threats** in a controlled environment.  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies I Used
During this project, I learned to use a range of tools that are widely used in cybersecurity:

- **VirtualBox** – to create and manage virtual machines  
- **Kali Linux** – as the attacker machine for simulations  
- **Windows 10** – as the target/victim machine  
- **Elastic Stack / Wazuh** – for SIEM monitoring and alerting  
- **Nmap & Hydra** – for simulating attacks like port scanning and brute-force attempts  
- **Filebeat / Winlogbeat** – to forward logs to the SIEM server  

Working with these tools helped me **develop practical skills in virtualization, network security, and log analysis**.

## 🏗️ Lab ArchitectureThis setup gave me a **realistic view of how attacks occur and how security systems detect them**.

## 🎯 What I Learned & Skills I Developed
Through building this lab, I gained:

- **SOC Operations:** Understanding how security analysts monitor and respond to threats  
- **Log Analysis:** Collecting and interpreting logs from Windows and Linux systems  
- **Threat Detection:** Detecting suspicious activity like brute force attempts or unauthorized access  
- **Virtualization & Networking:** Configuring multiple VMs and connecting them in a lab network  
- **Defensive Security Mindset:** Thinking like a blue team analyst to anticipate and mitigate attacks  

This project **helped me translate theory into practical skills** I can showcase to employers or in interviews.

## ⚙️ How I Built the Lab
1. Installed VirtualBox and set up virtualization on my PC  
2. Imported a Kali Linux VM and created a Windows 10 victim VM  
3. Configured Elastic Stack / Wazuh as a lightweight SIEM server  
4. Installed Winlogbeat/Filebeat to forward logs from the victim machine  
5. Simulated attacks from Kali Linux and observed alerts on the SIEM dashboard  
6. Documented all steps, results, and screenshots to showcase the project

## 📊 Attack Simulations
To demonstrate detection capabilities, I simulated:

- **Brute-force login attacks** using Hydra  
- **Port scanning** with Nmap  
- **Suspicious file execution** (safe EICAR test file)  

These activities **helped me see how a SIEM detects patterns and generates alerts in real-time**.

---

## 📸 Screenshots & Evidence
I plan to include screenshots of:

- Virtual machines running  
- SIEM dashboard and alerts  
- Logs showing detected attacks  

This **demonstrates my ability to execute, monitor, and document attacks ethically**.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps & Improvements
- Integrate Splunk for an alternative SIEM experience  
- Write custom detection rules for more advanced attacks  
- Add firewall and IDS systems (Snort/Suricata)  
- Simulate more complex attack scenarios like ransomware or phishing
